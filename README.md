<h1 align="center"> What Time is it? üïê</h1>

<p align="justify">
Creating an application for displaying the world clock using the polymorphism concepts. I used the libs Tkinter and PIL, algo used these modules: datetime, pytz and time.
  <br><br>
‚Ä¢ Datetime module: basically in python we do not have time and date as a data type, so, whenever we have to build any application which requires the use of time and date, we use a python module that is the ‚Äúdatetime‚Äù module. This datetime module provides certain classes, which includes various functions to deal with the date and time.
  <br>
  ‚Ä¢ Pytz module: The pytz module enables time-zone calculations in our Python applications. We will use pytz to extract correct time from different time zones in our application.
  <br>
  ‚Ä¢ Time: This is a popular time module available in Python which provides functions for working with times and for converting between representations.
